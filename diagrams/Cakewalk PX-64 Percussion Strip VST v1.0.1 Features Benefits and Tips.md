## Step 1: Adjust the Transient Shaper
 
The Transient Shaper is the first module in the PX-64 Percussion Strip. It allows you to control the attack and sustain of your drum sounds, making them more or less prominent in the mix. You can use the Attack knob to increase or decrease the initial impact of your drums, and the Sustain knob to adjust the length and decay of your drums. You can also use the Sensitivity knob to fine-tune how much the Transient Shaper affects your signal.
 
For example, if you want to make your kick drum more punchy and tight, you can increase the Attack and decrease the Sustain. If you want to make your snare drum more snappy and crisp, you can increase both the Attack and the Sustain. If you want to make your cymbals more smooth and airy, you can decrease both the Attack and the Sustain.
 
## Step 2: Adjust the Compressor/Expander
 
The Compressor/Expander is the second module in the PX-64 Percussion Strip. It allows you to control the dynamic range of your drum sounds, making them more or less consistent in volume. You can use the Threshold knob to set the level at which the compression or expansion kicks in, and the Ratio knob to set how much compression or expansion is applied. You can also use the Knee knob to adjust how smooth or abrupt the transition between compressed and uncompressed signals is.
 
For example, if you want to make your drum track more even and balanced, you can lower the Threshold and increase the Ratio to apply compression. If you want to make your drum track more dynamic and expressive, you can raise the Threshold and decrease the Ratio to apply expansion. If you want to make your compression or expansion more subtle or more aggressive, you can adjust the Knee accordingly.
 
## Step 3: Adjust the Equalizer
 
The Equalizer is the third module in the PX-64 Percussion Strip. It allows you to control the frequency balance of your drum sounds, making them more or less bright, warm or full. You can use the Low Cut knob to filter out unwanted low frequencies that may muddy up your mix, and the High Cut knob to filter out unwanted high frequencies that may sound harsh or noisy. You can also use the Low Shelf, Mid Peak and High Shelf knobs to boost or cut specific frequency bands of your choice.

If you want to make your cymbals more bright and shiny, you can boost the High Shelf around 10 kHz.
 
## Step 4: Adjust the Delay
 
The Delay is the fourth module in the PX-64 Percussion Strip. It allows you to add echo effects to your drum sounds, making them more spacious and interesting. You can use the Time knob to set how long it takes for each echo to repeat, and the Feedback knob to set how many times each echo repeats. You can also use the Mix knob to adjust how loud each echo is compared to the original signal.
 
For example, if you want to create a subtle ambience for your drum track, you can set a short Time (around 50 ms) and a low Feedback (around 10%). If you want to create a rhythmic groove for your drum
