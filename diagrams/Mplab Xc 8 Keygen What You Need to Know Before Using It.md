Congratulations! You have successfully installed and activated MPLAB XC8 Compiler PRO license on your computer. You can now enjoy the benefits of the compiler's advanced optimizations for your PIC projects.
  
## What are the benefits of MPLAB XC8 Compiler PRO mode?
 
MPLAB XC8 Compiler PRO mode offers several benefits over the free or standard modes, such as:

- Higher code optimization levels that can reduce code size by more than 50% and improve execution speed.
- Access to advanced features such as code packing, code obfuscation, data compression, and extended instruction set support.
- Ability to use MPLAB Code Configurator (MCC) to generate optimized code for peripherals and libraries.
- Ability to use MPLAB Harmony v3 to create modular and scalable applications for PIC18 devices.
- Access to High Priority Access (HPA) subscription that provides priority technical support and web access to new versions of the compiler.

## How to switch between MPLAB XC8 Compiler modes?
 
You can switch between MPLAB XC8 Compiler modes by changing the project properties in MPLAB X IDE. Follow these steps:

1. Open your project in MPLAB X IDE and right-click on it in the Projects window.
2. Select Properties from the pop-up menu.
3. Select Conf:[configuration name] > XC8 global options from the Categories list.
4. Select the Operating mode tab and choose the desired mode from the drop-down menu.
5. Click OK to apply the changes and rebuild your project.

You can also switch between MPLAB XC8 Compiler modes by using command-line options. For example, you can use -mode=pro to enable PRO mode or -mode=free to enable Free mode. See the MPLAB XC8 Compiler User's Guide for more details on command-line options.
