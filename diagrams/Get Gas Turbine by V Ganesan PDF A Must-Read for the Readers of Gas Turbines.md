Gas turbines are devices that convert the chemical energy of a fuel into mechanical energy by compressing and expanding a working fluid, usually air. The mechanical energy can be used to power various machines such as aircraft, ships, trains, generators and pumps. Gas turbines have many advantages over other types of engines, such as high power-to-weight ratio, high efficiency, low emissions and flexibility.
