## Balkan Music History and Influences
 
Balkan music has a rich and diverse history that reflects the cultural and historical interactions of the peoples of the region. The Balkans have been influenced by various musical traditions, such as Byzantine music, Ottoman music, Greek music, Slavic music, Roma music, Jewish music, and Western music. Each of these traditions has left its mark on the musical styles, instruments, scales, rhythms, and forms of Balkan music.
 
Byzantine music is the sacred chant of the Orthodox Christian churches that follow the Constantinopolitan rite. It is based on ancient Greek modes and uses a complex notation system called neumes. Byzantine music has influenced the liturgical music of all the Orthodox Balkan countries, as well as some secular genres such as rebetiko in Greece and izvorna muzika in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
 
Ottoman music is the art music of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled over most of the Balkans from the 14th to the 20th century. It is based on a system of modes called makams, which have specific melodic and harmonic characteristics. Ottoman music also uses microtonal intervals and complex rhythmic cycles called usuls. Ottoman music has influenced many urban genres of Balkan music, such as sevdalinka in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Äalgija in Macedonia, sÃ¢z in Bulgaria, and laiko in Greece.
