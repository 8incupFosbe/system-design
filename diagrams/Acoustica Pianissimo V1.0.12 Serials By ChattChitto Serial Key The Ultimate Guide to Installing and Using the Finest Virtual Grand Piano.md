The film is based on the true story of \*\*Maharajah Duleep Singh\*\*, the last king of the Sikh empire and the Punjab region, who was deposed by the British at the age of five and sent to England. There, he grew up under the care of \*\*Dr. John Login\*\*, a British surgeon who became his guardian. He also developed a close friendship with \*\*Queen Victoria\*\*, who treated him with affection and respect.
  
However, as he matured, Duleep Singh began to question his identity and his loyalty to the British crown. He longed to return to his homeland and reclaim his throne, but faced many obstacles and challenges from the British government. He also reconnected with his mother, \*\*Maharani Jinda\*\*, who had been imprisoned by the British for years. She encouraged him to embrace his Sikh heritage and fight for his rights.

Many reviewers praised the film's cinematography, costumes, and historical accuracy, but criticized the film's slow pacing, dull script, and lack of emotional impact. Some also felt that the film failed to explore the complexities and contradictions of Duleep Singh's personality and choices.
  
The film has a rating of 26% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 15 reviews, with an average score of 4.1/10. The site's consensus reads: \"The Black Prince is a beautifully photographed film and an interesting historical tale from the murky depths of mid-19th century British colonialism, but it's a bloodless tale, bereft of passion or pathos.\"
  
Some critics were more positive about the film, such as Jorge Ignacio Castillo from Darpan Magazine, who wrote: \"The Black Prince is a fascinating story that deserves to be told. It's also a reminder that history is written by the victors and that there are always different perspectives to consider.\" However, others were less impressed, such as Chris Knight from National Post, who wrote: \"The Black Prince may follow the formula of a prestige pic, but this messy film just shows why those truly stirring historical dramas deserve the awards season glory they get.\"
