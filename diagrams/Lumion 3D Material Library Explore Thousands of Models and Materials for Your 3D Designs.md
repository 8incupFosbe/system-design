The Lumion 3D material library is organized into categories and subcategories, which you can see on the left side of the window. You can expand or collapse each category by clicking on the arrow next to it. You can also use the search bar on the top of the window to find a specific material by typing its name or a keyword.
 
Each material has a thumbnail image that shows how it looks like on a flat surface. You can also see some information about each material, such as its name, category, subcategory, and size. You can hover your mouse over any material to see a larger preview of it.
