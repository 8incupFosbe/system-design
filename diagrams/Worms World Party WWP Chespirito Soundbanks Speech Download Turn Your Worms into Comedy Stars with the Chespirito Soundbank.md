One of the fun features of the game is that you can customize the soundbanks of your worms, which are the voices they use to taunt, cheer, or scream during the game. There are many soundbanks available online, but one of the most popular ones is the Chespirito soundbank, which is based on the characters and catchphrases of the Mexican comedian Roberto GÃƒÂ³mez BolaÃƒÂ±os.
