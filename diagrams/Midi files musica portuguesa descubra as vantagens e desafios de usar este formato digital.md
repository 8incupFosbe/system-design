Midi files are digital representations of musical notes that can be played by computers or electronic keyboards. They are often used to create backing tracks, karaoke versions, or remixes of songs. But did you know that midi files can also be a great way to enjoy Portuguese traditional music?
 
Portuguese traditional music is a rich and diverse genre that reflects the history and culture of Portugal and its regions. It includes folk songs, dances, instruments, and styles that vary from region to region. Some of the most popular forms of Portuguese traditional music are fado, a melancholic urban song that originated in Lisbon; corridinho, a lively dance from the Algarve; chula, a fast-paced dance from the Minho; and bailinho, a festive dance from Madeira.
